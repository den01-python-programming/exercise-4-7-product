# Exercise 4.7 Product

Create a class `Product` that represents a store product. The product should have a price, a quantity and a name.

The class should have:

- the constructor `def __init__(self, initial_name, initial_price, initial_quantity)`
- a method `def print_product()` that prints product information in the following format:

```plaintext
Banana, price 1.1, 13 pcs
```

The output above is based on the product being assigned the name `banana`, with a price of `1.1`, and a quantity of `13` .
